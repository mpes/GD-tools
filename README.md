#Remove metadata
Removes obsolete metadata from graphs. Use the filename of graph as a parameter.

Backups are created by default with _bckp suffix.
To change this behaviour use -n or --nobackup option.

Make it first executable "chmod +x remove_md.awk" and place it to the folder you like.

Use with caution! Report bugs.
